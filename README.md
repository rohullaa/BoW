# Bag of Words (BoW) Document Classification

This repo constains a simple bag-of-words document classifier. The bag-of-words model is a way of representing text data when modeling text with machine learning algorithms. The machine learning algorithms used is a simple feed-forward neural network. 

## Run the code
1. Produce the BOW representations
```
python3 dataset.py
```

2. Run the model
```
python3 main.py
```


## Requirements

1. Python 3
2. sklearn  ```pip install -U scikit-learn```
3. Pytorch ```pip install torch ```
4. tqdm ```pip install tqdm```
